Some of my projects include:

- Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis
> reads a text file of product reviews and uses two machine learning
algorithms (the Naïve Bayes
Classifier and the Decision
Tree Classifier) to analyze
the overall sentiment of each review and classify new unseen reviews with positive or negative sentiment.
Written in Python 3.

- Context Switching  Simulation in Java
> Simulates process switching by using different algorithms: Fist-Come-First-Served, Round-Robin, Shortest-Job-First, and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First

I have some large school group projects that exist only as private repositories due to concerns of our work being plagiarised. I am prepared to talk about these in an interview only. These include:

- CondoManager:
> a full-stack website with accompanying database. A social-media-style site for condo
owners. Frontend written in Angular, database is MySQL. Uses a custom RESTful API written in PHP to
interface the frontend with the database

- New Haven:
> a full, text-based, adaptation of the “New Haven” board game in C++ (with CMake)
